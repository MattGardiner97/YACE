# YACE (Yet Another CHIP-8 Emulator)

A CHIP-8 emulator written in C#. The system is a .NET Standard 2.0 class library, meaning it can be used within any UI framework such as Windows Forms, WPF, or theoretically even a web browser using Blazor.

## Features
* Runs CHIP-8 ROMs with correct timing
* Debug window
* Disassembler window
* Memory viewer (coming soon)
